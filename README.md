# Governance Framework

## Introduction

\[This Page is a non-normative general introduction to the governance framework whose purpose is to orient first-time readers as to the overall context of the governance framework.]

During Project Catalyst Fund 8 a challenge setting called Community Advisor Improvements was introduced. Several Community Advisors (now called Proposal Assessors) suggested that a proposal could be made to request a portion of the challenge funds for a CA (now called PA) community treasury. This treasury would be able to function as a rapid-funding mechanism for tools, efforts and related expenses to maintain and improve the Quality Assurance ecosystem, within the larger Catalyst ecosystem, and to function as a small experiment in decentralized self-governance. After discussion, it was decided that the CA representative for the Catalyst Circle v3 would submit the proposal on behalf of the community. The following Governance Framework has been created as an option for Trustees of the proposal to adopt in order to have objectively defined governance protocols for managing the integrity of the PA/(v)PA Operations Treasury. The proposal submitted to Catalyst regards the person who submitted the above proposal to be the Founding Trustee, and that role and its responsibilities are provisionally described in the Qualities of Distributed Leadership.

The PA/(v)PA Operations Treasury formally consists of a set of interrelated documents listed below that outline many areas of governance, and includes a glossary of terms, principles and objectives of the treasury, a schedule of controlled documents that govern specific aspects of the treasury, policies for revisions to the framework, and more. The Trustees may also request or adopt additional resources and documents for inclusion under this framework, such as whitepapers, FAQs, checklists, diagrams, etc. Additionally, a TIPs protocol (Treasury Improvement Proposal) allows iterative standards to be advanced by the QA community, and the need for several TIPs have been created during the genesis of this document, including a Risk Assessment TIP, a Quorum/Voting Protocol TIP and an Enhanced Claim Form TIP. All TIPs and their status are maintained in their own dedicated public repository. Please refer to the TIPs Governance Requirements Controlled Document, as well as TIP\_001 for more details.

This Governance Framework and its architecture, including controlled documents and trust registry is Version 1, and it is available both as an official document in the PA-vPA Treasury repository as well as a public comment version that collects feedback from the community. There was a previous version called Version 0, which was a template meant to capture initial data about the proposal, and it is also archived in the repository. Links and summaries for all of this documentation is available in the repository.

_This Governance Framework was adopted on June 1st, 2022._
